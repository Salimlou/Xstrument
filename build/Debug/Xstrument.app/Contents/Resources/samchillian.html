<h1>Visual Samchillian</h1>
<h2>Download</h2>
Visual Samchillian Software requires Leopard plus some recording studio software (like GarageBand, or an external MIDI device plugged in to the computer such as a keyboard) that will take MIDI instruments as input.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Samchillian is an instrument created by Leon Gruenbaum,
and it is basically a PC keyboard MIDI controller.
His version of this instrument is 
<a href="http://samchillian.com/samOSXmanual.html">here.</a>
It is easy to play very fast diatonic phrases on this instrument.
It also is prone to unusual phrasing because key presses express
a pitch relative to the current one.
One of the characteristics that I find interesting is that given that you might go everywhere with a laptop in your backpack already, you can have your instrument and the recording studio with you at all times.
Also, an external Samchillian controller could easily fit into the laptop bag; guitars and (most) keyboards cannot be taken with you everywhere you go.
<p> 
Visual Samchillian is my own (loosely interpreted!) implementation of the instrument.
When you start the Visual SamChillian (RChill.app) you see
a visual representation of the state of the instrument.
Every key you press will give either visual or audio feedback if it has
some effect.

Before you start RChill.app, you will need a place for the instrument to plug in to.  Go to 
<code>
/Applications/Utilities/Audio Midi Setup.app
</code>
and start that application.
Under the MIDI Devices tab, double click the IAC driver and make sure that the device is online.
<p>
Once you have done that, you should start up an application that takes MIDI input such as Garage band, or plug in a MIDI keyboard (as an output device).  When using a recording studio like Garage band, you will need to make sure that a MIDI track is selected and is prepared to respond to MIDI events.              
<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>
This is a quick document describing the use of this OSX version of the Visual SamChillian.
The keyboard layout is based on Leon Gruenbaum's implementation (in hardware and software).  
There are differences in how I have set up the keys on mine though.
<p>

<p>
Highlighted in red are the places where mine is different (and some keys blank on this map are not blank on Leon's layout as well).
The basic idea behind the original Samchillian is that playing pitches is always relative.
This makes it trivial to create phrases which transpose as they are played over and over again.
It also makes it very easy to play extremely fast, but sometimes difficult to do some simple things that you might be used to doing. 
And don't use your normal laptop keyboard to play the Samchillian on a regular basis.
You will have noticeable wear on your keys if you do so.

The Visual Samchillian provides a visualization that leaves the symmetries of the 12 tone well tempered music system visible.  
The log spiral was used as one of the geometric explainations for the well tempered music system we use today.  
What we have is much like a log spiral except the coordinates we plot on are scaled so that octaves are the same distance apart (rather than doubling the distance to the center at each octave...which had meant that frequency could actually be measured from a drawing).
The end result is that the notes go around a spiral, the symmetry about the octave is obvious (because it's just viewing from a different radius).
The symmetry between all of the chromatic notes is obvious as well, because the visualisation still has rotational symmetry.
The relativity of the Samchillian is all about trying to not destroy the inherent symmetries that lay beneath the music system.
<p>
The shaded areas are where the notes are in the current scale.
The purple tinted area is where the minor scale begins.
We treat the minor scale as THE fundamental scale, rather than the major scale.
One of the reasons for this is that we don't explicitly address flats - everything is translated into the language of sharps. 
The other reason is in how we handle the different scale shapes.
This is why the numbering of the notes starts at 1 on the purple shaded area.
The lighter blue area is where the major scale begins.  It is marked for convenience.  You will soon recognise 3 = major, 5 = phrygian, etc.
<p>
All of the modes
<i>
phrygian, minor, dorian, lydian, major, mixolydian, locrian
</i>
are present in these shapes.  But there are some common scale shapes that cannot be produced this way.  So, we have a key to #7 the minor scale when pressed once (to get the "Hebrew" scale), add a #6 as well when pressed again (to get "ascending melodic minor"), and back to minor when pressed again.  You can see that you are in the normal minor scale when the purple area doesn't have a shade area next to it.  You can see that you are in the hebrew scale when there is a gap two chromatic steps wide present.  It is common to use the Hebrew scale shape while playing with note 5 as the "center" (phrygian #3).
<ul>
<li><i>MV</i> means to move (diatonically) up or down some number of notes
<li><i>VOL</i> change the note volume (or velocity).  it doesn't make a sound when pressed, so chord it with other notes to start moving the volume up or down - or do this during a rest.  Notice that the volume reading in the center changes when these keys are pressed.
<li><i>CR</i> means to move (chromatically) up or down some number of notes
<li><i>VIB</i> means to bend a semitone, which is used for vibrato effects.  Press the 'z' key to see it visually shake the user interface as feedback.  If you play this with your pinky while holding down a different note, that note will bend up a chromatic step.
<li><i>CLR</i> means clear all current MIDI notes.
<i>There are TWO kinds of clear.  'q' means to clear notes so that they won't replay when play again, and 'Q' means to actually stop notes currently playing.
This feature is here so that you can let arpeggio centers ring through and change them as the melody is played.</i>  
Note that there are legitimate uses for stuck notes, because when a note is stuck it will sustain when it is played a second time.  
So, if you want to stick a note on purpose (so that the root of a scale will sustain when played for instance), then hold down shift AFTER the note is pressed and release that note while still holding down shift.  
The program sees 'a' go down and 'A' come up, so the note is stuck.  
This is a feature that I put time into making work correctly - no lie.
It is useful for lightly distorted or clean guitar sound, and somewhat useful for piano.   
As with any other stuck notes 'q' when you want to unstick them.
<li><i>SUS</i> The sustain key. Make sure that you are using a patch in which notes don't have to be turned off (such as a piano, rather than say...a screaming distorted electric guitar) before pressing the "~" key (<i>SHIFT-`</i>).  This causes the Samchillian to never send note off messages.  If you just made a lot of noise, then press 'Q' (CLR) to make it stop.  
<li><i>HEB</i> Twists the scale shape, which moves like <i>minor -> hebrew -> melodic minor ascent -> minor</i> each time it is pressed.  
<i>Pressing shift to generate '|' will change into a pseudo-pentatonic mode, where the scale shape is closer to pentatonic with two extra passing notes as is sometimes used in blues playing.  There are 3 variants based on the current scale twist; I could make it pentatonic, but that would mean repeated notes with the way that things are currently done.</i>
<li><i>Mouse</i> When you move the mouse in the Samchillian window, move higher to increase the current volume, and to the right to increase modulation.  Many instruments only sound right with the mouse in the upper left corner (no modulation, highest volume).  This does the same thing as the VOL keys.
<li><i>sharp/flat</i> changes the scale shape to add more sharps or to remove sharps (which is like adding a flat).  the star in the center associates red lines with sharps, and blue lines with flats.  this star tells you how far away the next adjacent minor scale.  If you are searching for a minor scale to change to, look at what color the line is.  If it's redder than it is blue, the the quickest way there is to start pressing "[" until you reach it (by adding sharps).  If it's bluer than it is red, then press "]" to get there.  Most of the time you will only use scales that are one move away from the one you are currently playing with.
<li><i>I .. VII</i> are deceptively simple keys.  They take you to the note with that number at the closest octave.  It is useful within the normal way of playing the Samchillian as a way to quickly jump to the note you want without having to figure out what the exact interval has to be.  But this happens to be just the rule to allow for fast arpeggiation from fixed pitches as well.  For example:
<ul>
<li>Ascending arpeggio:  1 3 5 1 3 5 
<li>Playing inverted arpeggio: 3 5 8 3 5 8
<li>Up and down: 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 3 1 5 3
<li>Mixed arrpegio: 1 3 5 2 4 6 3 5 7 8
</ul>
The order in which you play the notes determines which octave the notes end
up at.  This is because 5 (top of a triad) is closer to 8 (octave) than it is to 1 (root).
And as with any set of sequences in which no repeat key is involved, you can play notes slightly out of order and still arrive at the same note.  So you can play chords as you would on a normal keyboard here.  These keys seem most useful when playing background riffs that roughly follow an arpeggio but don't have to fit into a rigid pattern.
<p>
Also note that the I..VII keys have duplicates.  This makes it easier to
switch hands around to get the fingering correct.  Pressing the 8 and 1 key do the same thing, as do the 5 and = key.
On a normal keyboard, some hand crossing helps and is useful - but I try to avoid it as much as possible.
But that's not practical on some keyboards (like the one that Leon uses).
</ul>

<h2>Bugs, Missing features</h2>
<ul>
<li>None of the exotic microtonal scales of the official Samchillian are supported.  
If I supported anything, it would be the common Arabic scales and Just Intonation - as they seem to have some practical uses for me.  The simple MIDI pitchwheel message is completely wrong for this, because I need to actually re-tune all of the notes individually to exact pitches since the whole reason for Just Intonation is in how chords sound - we can't bend the down notes as a side effect of fine tuning the current note.  Apparently, exactly this is supported in the MIDI spec.  But I can't rely in it to be in software instruments and the like.

<li>No inline help, no icon settings, etc.  This is my first Cocoa app, and it lacks
polish at the moment.

<li>The port away from Objective-C for non OSX parts is done.  A Win32 port will not be hard to do now.

<li>Full screen resize doesn't work properly, or even maximize of OpenGL surface.  I can't get it to draw right, so I fixed the size... hoping it's not too big for 12in macbook users.
</ul>
